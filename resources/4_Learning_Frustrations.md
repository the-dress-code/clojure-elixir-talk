I actually did a talk last year about it called “When Your Disney Playlist Saves Your Tech Career” and TLDR get your butt out of your chair and move - jump around, dance, go be someone and somewhere else in your head for a little bit. You'll come back to your work with a clearer mind and better attitude.
